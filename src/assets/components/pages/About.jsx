      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Welcome! My name is Greg and I build things for the web. I began my coding journey writing web apps in Python using the Streamlit library, and recently switched to web development with HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Currently, I am studying MERN stacks at UC Berkley extension. I am always looking for new and interesting projects to work on, and enjoy colloaborating with developers who share my passion. If you have any questions, or would like to discuss a project, please reach out through any channels listed in the contact section.</p>
